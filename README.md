# Contact Manager — Java (RMI & Socket)

Two client-server contact management applications built in Java, both offering the same terminal-based experience (register, login, and manage a personal contact list) but implemented with different communication technologies.

## 📦 Projects

### [RMI-Contact-Manager](./rmi-contact-manager)
Built with **Java RMI** (Remote Method Invocation). The client calls methods on a remote server object as if they were local, with user data persisted via serialization in `users.data`.

### [Socket-Contact-Manager](./socket-contact-manager)
Built with **Java Sockets** (TCP) on port `3333`. The client and server exchange plain-text commands (`"log"`, `"add"`, `"remove"`, etc.) over raw input/output streams, with contact lists sent back as serialized objects.
